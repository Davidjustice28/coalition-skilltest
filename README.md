This is a webpage I made for a job interview. I was required to convert a Photoshop psd file into a responsive webpage in HTML

I used inline external CSS styles as well as a little Javascript

The following features were including:

- An carousel that automatically loops indefinitely 
- Nav menu items that link to internal sections on the same page
- Site is responsive for most Desktop/Laptops and mobile phones (still working on small tablet viewports)
